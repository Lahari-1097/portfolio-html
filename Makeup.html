          <h1>How is makeup done?</h1>
          <p>Everyone has different approaches to doing makeup. By using makeup you can express yourself. To make sure your makeup looks flawless, it always important to prep your skin first. Always moisturize before applying any type of makeup. It is suggested to use a primer to make sure your pores aren't visible through your makeup. 
          </p>

          <p>Using the right brushes and beauty blenders is crucial to hahing a flawless makeup look. For getting an airbrushed look with liquid and cream foundation, choose a flat-tipped brush with dense bristles. These brushes are so dense, they provide full coverage. Even better, it works for stippling (or patting) on foundation for a perfect finish. </p>
          
          <p> For Contouring, choose a wide, flat brush with ultrashort bristles.These let you easily contour your face around your nose and cheekbone for a chiseled look. It'll help give your face more definition.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For applying eye-shadow, try a brush with flexible pointed bristles. The pointed shape is helpful for getting into the corners and creases of the eye.The flexible bristles also help you deposit color and blend.
          </p>
          <p>
            For blending eye shadow, go for a small firm but fluffy brush with rounded edges.
          </p>

            While choosing a foundation, it is important you know your skin tone. Remember the purpose of wearing foundation is not to make your skin look lighter, but it's to give a proper base for doing your makeup. Once you know skin color and undertone, your search for the right foundation shade narrows down considerably. You will, most likely, by now have a handful of foundations shades to choose from. In such a scenario it’s best to test the shades on your skin and find the perfect match.Start by shortlisting three shades that seem to be a good match. Then, dab some of each shade as short lines on your jaw line (do keep some space in between each). Don’t just consider your face for making the final decision but also your neck. The foundation you choose should blend seamlessly with both your face and your neck. You can apply foundation with a makeup brush or a beauty blender. Make sure to dab the beauty blender in water before use.

          <p>Concealer is that beauty essential that can brighten up a face, cover up blemishes and minimize under-eye circles and discoloration. It also tends to be one of the first categories of makeup that people buy—but choosing the correct shade or formula can also be a bit stressful.Here are a few tricks to get the right product for you. You can camouflage an imperfection with concealer before layering a fuller coverage product onto the skin. But if you are not subtle with it, the concealer can feel heavy and look cakey. How do you prevent this? Apply foundation first to see how much of the dark circles, blemishes and spots that the foundation can cover on its own. Then, if you need more coverage, go back in with a thin layer of concealer directly on the area. You will be amazed at how little product you actually need. When choosing under-eye concealer, choose a color that is one or two shades lighter than your skin tone. You always want your foundation to match the skin but with concealer a shade lighter will help give a lifting effect. A big mistake many people make is choosing the wrong shade. When deciding what product to purchase for concealing, dark spots need something that is close to the shade of your foundation. To eradicate the dark pigment, I suggest the fuller coverage of a cream concealer. Cream concealer has a fuller texture but will need to be set with powder so it will last longer. I recommend applying the concealer with a soft shadow brush only where there is darkness, and then setting it with an invisible powder or setting powder. I like to blend concealer with the help of my fingers as they dont absorb the product.</p>
          <p>
            Once you're done setting your face with setting powder, it's time to contour your face. Contouring helps in defining the face, and giving more stucture. Remember to use the proper shade of contour based on your skin tone. You can even contour your nose if you want to make it look more sharp. Using a blush is a a great way to add more warmth in your face. Use it on the apples of your cheek bones. You could also apply it on your nose, chin and forehead. The last product use for the base would be a highlighter. It is used to highlight the high points on your face.
