          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>My name is Lahari Prathapagiri and I am currently working as a software developer. I have always been fond of fashion from my childhood, but never really got the opportunity to explore that side as my focus was more inclined towards my academics. It was during college that I discovered how much diverse fashion is and that each person had their own definition for fashion.
          </p>

          <p>I have created this website to share my insights on fashion, beauty and lifestyle. I'll be talking about things like how one should care for their skin, techniques used to make your make-up look flawless, experimenting with fashion and the importance of mental health. Please do go through it, you may come across something helpful. Thank you. </p>
