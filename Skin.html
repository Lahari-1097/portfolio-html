          <h1>Good skin care is important for the following reasons</h1>
          <p>It helps your skin stay in good condition: You’re shedding skin cells throughout the day, so it’s important to keep your skin glowing and in good condition. An effective routine can help prevent acne, treat wrinkles, and help keep your skin looking its best.
          </p>

          <p>Your skin will look more youthful: As you age, your skin’s cells turn over more slowly, make it look duller and less radiant. Using a quality skin care line can help remove dead skin cells so your body will replace them with newer, more youthful cells. </p>
          <p>Prevention is easier than correction: Preventing skin problems is easier -– and less costly – than trying to fix them in the future. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Your self-confidence will get a boost: When your skin looks better, you’ll feel better about yourself and have more self-confidence.

            A basic skin care starts with using a face wash which suits your skin type. Gently rub your face in a circular motion and rinse. Next step is to moisturize your skin. Moisturizing everyday can reduce the chance of developing extreme dryness or oiliness. Also don't forget to apply a lip balm on your lips.  Never skin using a sunscreen when stepping out of the house. You could also use a sheet mask once a week. They bring fast effects in regards to enhancing the skin. The serum is filled with various vitamins and minerals, and won’t dry out the skin compared to the paste-type face mask. The sheet on your face helps the serum to soak in your skin a little longer. Basically, sheet masks are inexpensive compared to going to a spa, convenient, easy to apply, and brings a glowing effect on your skin.
