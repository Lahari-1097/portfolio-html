          <h1>Hair must be given equal importance.</h1>
          <p>Hair care is a very important and a hygienic routine for both men and women. Nobody wants to go out with a frizzy, dry and unhealthy hair. By just washing your hair doesn’t necessarily mean you are sure you’ve done it right, hair care also involves proper grooming and making sure you are using the right hair care products.
          </p>

          <p> Hair care doesn't necessarily involve using high end products used by celebrities. Oiling your hair twice a week with coconut oil ensures moisturization of the scalp and prevents dandruff. You could even add other natural ingredients to your coconut oil hair mask  such as aloe Vera gel, a whole egg or egg white, an avocado and olive oil. Make sure to heat the oil before applying it, and massage your scalp with your finger tips. Leave it on for for a few hours, or over night, and rinse it off with a mild shampoo, basically a shampoo which does not lather too much. </p>
